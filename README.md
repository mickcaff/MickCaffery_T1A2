# Target audience

The target audiences are prospective clients and employers. I have made the assumption that viewers have a basic understanding of programming languages and development stacks.

# Tech stack

The site was built and styled by myself with basic **HTML** and **CSS**. There was no use of any framework. The site has been deployed on **GitHub Pages**.
