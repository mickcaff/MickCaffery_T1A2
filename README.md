# Purpose

The purpose of this website is to showcase myself as a software developer to employers and prospective clients. The website provides information about my professional background, skills, interests and coding abilities.


# Functionality / features

The website has adopted a simple and classic aesthetic with a common theme, in order to deliver the information in a straightforward manner with a high degree of clarity. 

### The website contains the following features:

- A simple **navigation header** displays my name, avatar and navigational links. This is used to navigate between all the main pages. 

- The **home page** contains a hero photo of myself and the short introductory paragraph, followed by a link to my PDF resume. The home page footer contains links to my LinkedIn and GitHub accounts. 

- The **about page** details my professional backstory, along with information about my interests, development skills, and tech stack. 

- The **blog page** simply lays out all blog posts in a grid formation. Each blog has a hero photo which is clearly displayed on a square tile, with blog title and date overlayed. 

- **Blog article pages** clearly show the article's hero photo followed by title, date and contents of the article. A narrow colomn on the right side displays information about me, recent posts, and links to socials.

- The **contact page** has a message input form, and also details my address, phone number, email and links to Linkedin, Github, and a link to my PDF resume.

# Target audience

The target audiences are prospective clients and employers. I have made the assumption that viewers have a basic understanding of programming languages and development stacks.

# Tech stack

The site was built and styled by myself with basic **HTML** and **CSS**. There was no use of any framework. The site has been deployed on **GitHub Pages**.
